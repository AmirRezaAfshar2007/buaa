// piece of real complexity this migration added; everything else is a
// like-for-like client swap.
// --- Silence / empty-recording detection ------------------------------------
//
// Root cause of the "hallucinated transcript" bug: analyzeSpeaking() used to
// hand every recording straight to Qwen-Omni and trust whatever transcript it
// returned, even for a completely silent/empty clip. LLMs asked to
// "transcribe this audio" will often produce a plausible-sounding sentence
// rather than admitting they heard nothing — that's the hallucination the
// user hit. Asking the model more nicely in the prompt is not a reliable fix
// on its own, so detection now happens twice, independently:
//   1. Deterministic, non-AI signal: ffmpeg's volumedetect filter measures
//      the actual decoded peak/mean loudness of the clip. True silence (or a
//      near-empty recording) measures far below any real speech, regardless
//      of what any model would guess. If this fires, we never even call the
//      AI — there is nothing to hallucinate about.
//   2. Model self-report: the analysis prompt requires Qwen to return an
//      empty transcript when it doesn't hear real speech, and the parsed
//      response is validated for that afterward (see analyzeSpeaking), so a
//      borderline clip that passes step 1 but that the model genuinely can't
//      make out still can't be scored as if it were a real answer.

CRITICAL RULE — DO NOT HALLUCINATE: Only transcribe words you can actually, confidently hear spoken in the audio. If the audio contains no intelligible speech at all — for example it is silent, contains only background noise, static, breathing, or is too muffled/garbled to make out real words — you MUST NOT invent, guess, or reconstruct a plausible-sounding sentence. In that exact case, set "transcript" to an empty string "", set "transcriptPinyin" to an empty string "", set every score in "scores" to 0, leave "strengths" and "mispronuncedWords" and "suggestedPhrases" as empty arrays, and set "improvementTips" to ["${NO_SPEECH_MESSAGE}"]. This rule overrides every instruction below — never fabricate content to fill in the response shape.

If (and only if) you do hear real, intelligible speech, listen to the audio and:
1. Transcribe exactly what the speaker said in Chinese characters (Hanzi), in the "transcript" field. If they spoke partly or entirely in English or another language instead, transcribe what was actually said and reflect that honestly in your scoring. Never paraphrase, complete, or "clean up" a sentence into something the speaker didn't actually say.
2. Provide the Hanyu Pinyin (with tone marks) for that same transcript in the "transcriptPinyin" field.
3. Score their performance from 0-100 in four categories:
   - pronunciation: clarity of initials/finals and, most importantly, TONE ACCURACY (Mandarin is a tonal language — wrong tones should meaningfully lower this score even if the sounds themselves were clear)
   - grammar: Mandarin sentence structure, word order, correct use of particles (了, 的, 吗, 呢, etc.) and measure words
   - fluency: speaking speed, pauses, hesitation, natural flow
   - vocabulary: word variety and appropriateness for the difficulty level
4. Compute an overall score (0-100) reflecting the four categories. Be strict and realistic — do not give a generous score to a short, hesitant, or partial answer just to be encouraging. A one- or two-word fragment is not a complete answer to the prompt and should score low on fluency and overall, even if the words themselves were pronounced correctly.
5. List 2-4 specific strengths (in English, but you may reference specific Chinese words/phrases).
6. List 2-4 specific, actionable improvement tips (in English, referencing what was actually said — for tone issues, name the specific character and which tone they used vs. the correct one).
7. List up to 5 individual Chinese words or characters that were mispronounced, tonally incorrect, or unclear, if any (empty array if none).
8. Suggest up to 3 alternative Chinese words or phrases that would sound more natural or advanced for what they were trying to say.
